Create an ultra-realistic photographic image (16:9) with high sharpness and soft natural lighting. The composition must look like a clean studio-style setup with a seamless pure white background, as if placed on a white canvas for a website system interface. There must be no visible wall lines, no corners, and no depth cues — only a smooth white backdrop and white surface, creating a modern, minimal commercial look.

The framing must be half-body (from approximately mid-torso up), not full body. The camera should be closer to the subject to create stronger focus on the action. The composition must prioritize the interaction between the smartphone and the QR code, reducing empty space and avoiding a distant look.

Emily is a 1.65m tall young woman in her mid-20s. She has long, deep black hair styled in a sleek low ponytail with a precise middle part, smooth and glossy, neatly arranged behind her shoulders. She is not wearing glasses. Her expression is sweet, confident, and harmonious, with a soft natural smile (no exaggerated laughter). Her posture is slightly leaning forward in a natural, engaged way.

She is wearing a sophisticated and elegant outfit, modest and refined: a fitted long-sleeve blouse in soft pastel blue satin, fully covering her torso, with a structured light nude-beige blazer featuring subtle gold button details. Accessories include medium-sized gold hoop earrings and layered gold bracelets. Hands are delicate and well-groomed with neutral nail polish.

Visible in the scene:
• A heavy supermarket meat product sealed in a styrofoam tray with transparent plastic wrapping and a clearly visible QR code label on top.
• A modern smartphone held firmly in Emily’s hand.
• A sleek stainless-steel kitchen sink integrated into the white countertop.
• A minimalist chrome faucet correctly oriented facing toward Emily (as if she is standing in front of it ready to use it). The faucet’s curved spout must face her, not away.
• A simple white grocery shopping bag placed beside the packaged product.

The most important element of the image is the scanning action. Emily must clearly be pointing the smartphone directly at the QR code on the packaged meat. The phone must be positioned approximately 15 cm away from the product. The camera lens must be visibly aligned and aimed straight at the QR code. The angle of her wrist and the phone orientation must make it unmistakable that she is scanning. The QR code must face the camera, be well-lit, and clearly readable. The smartphone’s rear camera must clearly be directed toward it.

The interaction between the phone and the QR code must be the central visual focus of the composition. The tighter 16:9 half-body framing should enhance clarity, realism, and emphasis on the scanning action.

No additional objects, no clutter, no background walls, no decorative elements. Only the essential elements in a clean, minimal white canvas environment.
