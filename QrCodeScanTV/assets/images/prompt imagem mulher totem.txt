Create an ultra-realistic premium commercial image in 16:9 format designed for clear long-distance readability inside a supermarket self-service totem, maintaining the same composition with the actress in strict side profile scanning the product, but optimizing typography for maximum legibility. Use a softly blurred minimalist white kitchen background with bright neutral lighting and strong separation between foreground and background. On the left side, create a large high-contrast text block using an elegant serif font with clean edges and strong readability; “Aponte a câmera do seu celular” in deep dark brown almost black (#2B2B2B), “para o QR Code.” in a flat warm golden tone with reduced metallic shine, “Fale com o Maguinho.” in slightly larger warm golden tone for emphasis, and “Receba dicas e receitas especiais!” in strong solid red with high contrast. Increase spacing between lines slightly to improve distance readability and avoid excessive decorative flourishes. Below and integrated with the text, place the Maguinho character generated strictly from the provided reference image without redesign; his magical effect must be softer and more controlled, forming a subtle flowing golden contour that gently outlines and partially encircles the text, creating a light luminous halo around the letters without overpowering them, with reduced sparkles and reduced glow intensity, ensuring the magic enhances readability instead of competing with it. On the right side, maintain the actress exactly as before: strict side profile facing right, slightly leaning forward, holding the packaged beef product with her left hand and holding the smartphone with her right hand, matching the reference action precisely; her hair loose with soft waves, wearing the light nude-beige structured blazer over a soft light blue V-neck blouse with minimal gold jewelry. The packaged beef must remain in a black supermarket tray wrapped in transparent plastic film with the QR Code attached to the plastic film and centered; the smartphone must be approximately 15 cm from the product with the back camera aligned directly toward the QR Code, and the front screen clearly visible displaying the captured QR Code exactly where she is looking, making the scanning interaction unmistakable. The final result must feel clean, premium, highly readable from distance, visually balanced, and seamlessly integrated with the system interface above.
