Create an ultra-realistic premium commercial image in 16:9 format designed for strong long-distance readability inside a supermarket self-service totem.

BACKGROUND
Use a softly blurred minimalist white kitchen environment with bright neutral lighting and strong foreground separation. The background must be clean and seamless, with no visible wall lines, creating a modern commercial system interface look.

MODEL
Young woman in her mid-20s, light skin, natural makeup, soft confident expression. She must have loose hair with soft natural waves (not tied, not ponytail). Hair must look healthy, slightly voluminous, naturally falling over shoulders.

She is wearing:
• A structured light nude-beige blazer (similar to the reference image)
• A soft light blue blouse underneath (modest neckline, elegant and refined)
• Minimal gold jewelry

She is in strict side profile facing right, slightly leaning forward in a natural engaged posture.

ACTION (CRITICAL DETAIL)
She is holding a packaged beef product in her left hand. The product is in a black supermarket tray wrapped in transparent plastic film. The QR Code is attached to the plastic film and centered on the package.

She holds a smartphone in her right hand, approximately 15 cm away from the product. The back camera must be aligned directly toward the QR Code. The front screen must clearly display the QR Code being scanned, exactly where she is looking. The scanning interaction must be unmistakable and visually obvious.

TYPOGRAPHY – LEFT SIDE TEXT BLOCK

Use a bold elegant serif font with thick strokes and excellent distance readability.

Level 1 (Instruction – dominant block in deep purple #4B2A75):

“Aponte a câmera do seu celular”
“para o QR Code e fale com o Maguinho.”

Both lines in solid deep purple (#4B2A75), strong weight, flat color (no gradient, no metallic effect). Increase line spacing slightly for clarity.

Level 2 (Benefit – strong highlight in solid gold #F2C94C):

“Receba dicas e receitas especiais!”

This line must be larger than the instruction lines, in solid warm gold (#F2C94C), flat color, bold weight. Add subtle extra vertical spacing before this line to create visual hierarchy and strong emphasis.

No red. No green. No gradient. Only flat purple and flat gold.

MAGUINHO
Place the Maguinho character below or slightly integrated with the text block, strictly based on the provided reference image without redesign. His magical effect must be soft warm gold light (#F2C94C), subtly flowing upward toward the benefit line, without overlapping or reducing text readability. Keep glow minimal and controlled.

FINAL RESULT
The image must feel premium, clean, highly readable from distance, visually balanced, brand-consistent with a purple and gold supermarket interface, and optimized for a totem display environment.
